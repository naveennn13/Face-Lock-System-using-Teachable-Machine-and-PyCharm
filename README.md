Project Title: Face Lock System using Teachable Machine and PyCharm

Overview:
The Face Lock System combines machine learning with Python programming to create a secure authentication mechanism based on facial recognition. Teachable Machine is used to train a model to recognize authorized faces, and PyCharm is utilized to implement the locking function, allowing access only to recognized faces.

Components:
1. Teachable Machine:
   - Train a model using Teachable Machine to recognize authorized faces.
   - Collect and label images of authorized individuals to create a dataset.
   - Train the model to distinguish between authorized and unauthorized faces.

2. PyCharm:
   - Develop a Python script to interface with a webcam for real-time face detection.
   - Integrate the trained model from Teachable Machine into the Python script for face recognition.
   - Implement a locking mechanism that denies access to unrecognized faces.
   - Optionally, include features such as logging access attempts or sending notifications for security purposes.

Project Implementation Steps:
1. Data Collection and Model Training:
   - Collect a dataset of images containing the faces of authorized individuals.
   - Use Teachable Machine's web interface to upload and label the collected images.
   - Train the model to recognize authorized faces and export the trained model.

2. Setting Up PyCharm Environment:
   - Install necessary Python packages such as OpenCV for image processing and TensorFlow for model integration.
   - Create a new Python script in PyCharm to implement the face lock functionality.

3. Face Recognition Implementation:
   - Use OpenCV to access the webcam feed and perform real-time face detection.
   - Integrate the trained Teachable Machine model into the Python script for face recognition.
   - Implement logic to compare detected faces with the authorized faces recognized by the model.

4. Locking Functionality:
   - Develop a mechanism in Python to deny access or trigger a lock when an unrecognized face is detected.
   - Implement additional features such as a timer-based lock or a manual unlock option.

5. Testing and Deployment:
   - Test the Face Lock System thoroughly to ensure accurate face recognition and reliable locking functionality.
   - Deploy the system on the desired hardware platform, such as a desktop computer or a Raspberry Pi.

Conclusion:
The Face Lock System combines the power of Teachable Machine for facial recognition model training and PyCharm for Python programming to create a robust and secure authentication mechanism based on facial recognition. This project demonstrates the integration of machine learning with real-world applications for enhanced security and convenience.
